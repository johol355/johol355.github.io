	abstract = {Background: Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a serious form of stroke, for which rapid access to specialist neurocritical care is associated with better outcomes. Delays in the treatment of aSAH appear to be common and may contribute to poor outcomes. We have a limited understanding of the extent and causes of these delays, which hinders the development of interventions to reduce delays and improve outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to quantify and identify factors associated with time to treatment in aSAH.
Methods: This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (Reg. No. CRD42019132748). We searched four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Google Scholar) for manuscripts published from January 1998 using pre-designated search terms and search strategy. Main outcomes were duration of delays of time intervals from onset of aSAH to definitive treatment and/or factors related to time to treatment.
Results: A total of 64 studies with 16 different time intervals in the pathway of aSAH patients were identified. Measures of time to treatment varied between studies (e.g. cut-off timepoints or absolute mean/median duration). Factors associated with time to treatment fell into two categories—individual (n = 9 factors, e.g. age, sex and clinical characteristics) and health system (n = 8 factors, e.g. pre-hospital delay or presentation out-of-hours). Demographic factors were not associated with time to treatment. More severe aSAH reduced treatment delay in most studies. Pre-hospital delays (patients delay, late referral, late arrival of ambulance, being transferred between hospitals or arriving at the hospital outside of office hours) were associated with treatment delay. In-hospital factors (patients with complications, procedure before definitive treatment, slow work-up and type of treatment) were less associated with treatment delay.
Conclusions: The pathway from onset to definitive treatment of patients with aSAH consists of multiple stages with multiple influencing factors. This review provides the first comprehensive understanding of extent and factors associated with time to treatment of aSAH. There is},

	abstract = {For a continuous treatment, the generalised propensity score (GPS) is deﬁned as the conditional density of the treatment, given covariates. GPS adjustment may be implemented by including it as a covariate in an outcome regression. Here, the unbiased estimation of the dose–response function assumes correct speciﬁcation of both the GPS and the outcometreatment relationship. This paper introduces a machine learning method, the ‘Super Learner’, to address model selection in this context. In the two-stage estimation approach proposed, the Super Learner selects a GPS and then a dose–response function conditional on the GPS, as the convex combination of candidate prediction algorithms. We compare this approach with parametric implementations of the GPS and to regression methods. We contrast the methods in the Risk Adjustment in Neurocritical care cohort study, in which we estimate the marginal effects of increasing transfer time from emergency departments to specialised neuroscience centres, for patients with acute traumatic brain injury. With parametric models for the outcome, we ﬁnd that dose–response curves differ according to choice of speciﬁcation. With the Super Learner approach to both regression and the GPS, we ﬁnd that transfer time does not have a statistically signiﬁcant marginal effect on the outcomes. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background—Correlated data are ubiquitous in epidemiologic research, particularly in nutritional and environmental epidemiology where mixtures of factors are studied. Our objective is to demonstrate how highly correlated data arise in epidemiologic research and provide guidance on how to proceed analytically when faced with highly correlated data utilizing a directed acyclic graph approach.
Methods—We identified three fundamental structural scenarios in which high correlation between a given variable and the exposure can arise: intermediates, confounders, and colliders. For each of these scenarios we evaluated the consequences of increasing correlation between the given variable and the exposure on the bias and variance for the total effect of the exposure on the outcome using unadjusted and adjusted models. We derived closed form solutions for continuous outcomes using linear regression and empirically present our findings for binary outcomes using logistic regression.
Results—For models properly specified, total effect estimates remained unbiased even when there was almost perfect correlation between the exposure and a given intermediate, confounder, or collider. In general, as the correlation increased the variance of the parameter estimate for the exposure in the adjusted models increased, while in the unadjusted models it increased to a lesser extent or decreased.
Conclusion—Our findings highlight the importance of considering the causal framework under study when specifying regression models. Strategies that do not take into consideration the causal structure may lead to biased effect estimation for the original question of interest, even under high correlation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injured patients cared for in trauma centers have a lower risk of death than those cared for in nontrauma centers. However, many patients are transported to a non-trauma center after injury (undertriaged) and require transfer to trauma center care. Previous analyses of undertriage focused only on survivors to trauma center care and were potentially subject to survivor bias. Using a novel population-based design, we evaluated the true mortality cost of undertriage. STUDY DESIGN: We used a retrospective cohort design and included all severely injured patients surviving to reach an emergency department within the province of Ontario, Canada. Those patients who were triaged to a non-trauma center as their first hospital exposure were the Undertriage cohort. Undertriage cohort patients were either transferred to a trauma center (Transfer cohort) or died before transfer could be accomplished (emergency department–death cohort). Patients that were transported directly from the scene of injury to a trauma center represented the Direct cohort. Thirty-day mortality in undertriaged patients was analyzed using two approaches: allowing for survivor bias (Transfer versus Direct) and without survivor bias (Undertriage versus Direct).
RESULTS: Among 11,398 patients, 66\% were transported directly to a trauma center and 30\% were transferred. Four percent died before transfer (22\% of all deaths). Reproducing approaches that ignore survivor bias, mortality in the Transfer and Direct cohorts was equivalent. However, unbiased assessment demonstrated that mortality was significantly higher in the Undertriage cohort than the Direct cohort (odds ratio ϭ 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.10–1.40).
CONCLUSIONS: Undertriage after major trauma is associated with substantial mortality. These data suggest a need to design strategies to improve triage to trauma center. (J Am Coll Surg 2010;211: 804–811. © 2010 by the American College of Surgeons)},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the association between specialty ICU care and the outcome of critical illness.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study design analyzing patients admitted to 124 ICUs participating in the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV from January 2002 to December 2005. We examined 84,182 patients admitted to specialty and general ICUs with an admitting diagnosis or procedure of acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, pneumonia, abdominal surgery, or coronary-artery bypass graft surgery. ICU type was determined by a local data coordinator at each site. Patients were classiﬁed by admission to a general ICU, a diagnosis-appropriate (‘‘ideal’’) specialty ICU, or a diagnosis-inappropriate (‘‘non-ideal’’) specialty ICU. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and ICU length of stay.
Measurements and Main Results: After adjusting for important confounders, there were no signiﬁcant differences in risk-adjusted mortality between general versus ideal specialty ICUs for all conditions other than pneumonia. Risk-adjusted mortality was signiﬁcantly greater for patients admitted to non-ideal specialty ICUs. There was no consistent effect of specialization on length of stay for all patients or for ICU survivors.
Conclusions: Ideal specialty ICU care appears to offer no survival beneﬁt over general ICU care for select common diagnoses. Non-ideal specialty ICU care (i.e., ‘‘boarding’’) is associated with increased riskadjusted mortality.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—The purpose of this study was to analyze whether treating ruptured intracranial aneurysms within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage improves clinical outcome.
Methods—An 11-year database of consecutive ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular coiling or craniotomy and clipping was analyzed. Outcome was measured by the modified Rankin Scale at 6 months. Our policy is to treat all cases within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Treatment delays are due to nonclinical logistical factors.
Results—Two hundred thirty cases were coiled or clipped within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage and 229 at Ͼ24 hours. No difference in age, gender, smoking, family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysm size, or aneurysm location was found between the groups. Poor World Federation of Neurological Surgeons clinical grade patients were overrepresented in the ultra-early group. Increasing age and higher World Federation of Neurological Surgeons clinical grade were predictors of poor outcome. Eight point zero percent of cases treated within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage (ultra-early) were dependent or dead at 6 months compared with 14.4\% of those treated at Ͼ24 hours (delayed), a 44.0\% relative risk reduction and a 6.4\% absolute risk reduction (␹2, Pϭ0.044). A total of 3.5\% of cases coiled within 24 hours were dependent or dead at 6 months compared with 12.5\% of cases coiled at 1 to 3 days, an 82\% relative risk reduction and a 10.2\% absolute risk reduction (␹2, Pϭ0.040). These groups did not differ in age, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons clinical grade, aneurysm size, or aneurysm location.
Conclusions—Treatment of ruptured aneurysms within 24 hours is associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with treatment at Ͼ24 hours. The benefit is more pronounced for coiling than clipping. (Stroke. 2011;42:1936-1945.)},

	abstract = {Background: High systolic blood pressure (SBP) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has been associated with an increased risk of rebleeding. It remains unclear if an SBP lowering strategy before aneurysm treatment decreases this risk without increasing the risk of a delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Therefore, we compared the rates of in-hospital rebleeding and DCI among patients with aSAH admitted in two tertiary care centers with different SBP management strategies.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients from Utrecht and Toulouse admitted within 24 h after the aSAH onset were enrolled. In Toulouse, the target SBP before aneurysm treatment was ≤140 mm Hg, while, in Utrecht, an increased SBP was only treated in extreme situations. We compared SBP levels, the incidence of rebleeding within 24 h after admission, and DCI during hospitalization.
Results: We enrolled 373 patients in Utrecht and 149 in Toulouse. The mean SBP on admission was similar but lower in Toulouse 4 h after admission (127.3 ± 17.4 vs. 138. ± 25.7 mmHg; p {\textless} 0.0001). After a median delay of 3.7 h (IQR, 2.3–7.4) from admission, 4 patients (3\%) in Toulouse vs. 29 (8\%) in Utrecht experienced a rebleeding. After adjustment for Prognosis on Admission of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (PAASH) score, aneurysm size, age, and delay from ictus to admission, the HR was 0.66 (95\% CI: 0.23–1.92). Incidence of DCI was 18\% in Toulouse and 25\% in Utrecht (adjusted OR, 0.68; 95\% CI: 0.41–1.11).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that an intensive SBP lowering strategy between admission and aneurysm treatment does not decrease the risk of rebleeding and does not increase the risk of DCI compared to a more conservative strategy.},

	abstract = {Objectives  The development and implementation of incident reporting systems within healthcare continues to be a fundamental strategy to reduce preventable patient harm and improve the quality and safety of healthcare. We sought to identify factors contributing to patient safety incident reporting. Design  To facilitate improvements in incident reporting, a theoretical framework, encompassing factors that act as barriers and enablers ofreporting, was developed. Embase, Ovid MEDLINE(R) and PsycINFO were searched to identify relevant articles published between January 1980 and May 2014. A comprehensive search strategy including MeSH terms and keywords was developed to identify relevant articles. Data were extracted by three independent researchers; to ensure the accuracy of data extraction, all studies eligible for inclusion were rescreened by two reviewers.
Results  The literature search identified 3049 potentially eligible articles; of these, 110 articles, including {\textgreater}29 726 participants, met the inclusion criteria. In total, 748 barriers were identified (frequency count) across the 110 articles. In comparison, 372 facilitators to incident reporting and 118 negative cases were identified. The top two barriers cited were fear of adverse consequences (161, representing 21.52\% of barriers) and process and systems of reporting (110, representing 14.71\% of barriers). In comparison, the top two facilitators were organisational (97, representing 26.08\% of facilitators) and process and systems of reporting (75, representing 20.16\% of facilitators).
Conclusion  A wide range of factors contributing to engagement in incident reporting exist. Efforts that address the current tendency to under-report must consider the full range of factors in order to develop interventions as well as a strategic policy approach for improvement.},

	abstract = {Background: Critical care transfers between hospitals are time critical high-risk episodes for unstable patients who often require urgent lifesaving intervention. This study aimed to establish the scale, nature and safety of current transfer practice in the South West Critical Care Network (SWCCN) in England.
Methods: The SWCCN database contains prospectively collected data in accordance with national guidelines. It was interrogated for all adult ({\textgreater}15 years of age) patients from January 2012 to November 2017.
Results: A total of 1124 inter-hospital transfers were recorded, with the majority (935, 83.2\%) made for specialist treatment. The transferring team included a doctor in 998 (88.8\%) and nurse in 935 (93.7\%) transfers. In 204 (18.1\%) transfers, delays occurred, with the commonest cause being availability of transport. Critical incidents occurred in 77 (6.9\%).
Conclusions: This is the first published data on the transfer activity of a UK adult critical care network. It demonstrates that current ad-hoc provision is not meeting the longstanding expectations of national guidelines in terms of training, clinical experience and timeliness. The authors hope that this study may inform national conversation regarding the development of National Health Service commissioned inter-hospital transfer services for adult patients in England.},

	abstract = {Methods  The authors identified patients treated for intracranial aneurysms between 2002 and 2010 from patient registries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and linked to data on 1-year mortality from the population registry of each country. Cox regression models were used to relate hospital volume to the risk of death and adjusted for potential confounders (age, sex, year of treatment, Charlson comorbidity index, country, and surgical treatment).
Results  The authors identified 5773 patients with ruptured and 1756 patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, treated at 15 hospitals. One-year mortality rates were 15.6\% for patients with ruptured aneurysms and 2.7\% for patients with unruptured aneurysms. No consistent relationship was found between hospital volume and 1-year mortality for ruptured aneurysms in the unadjusted analyses, but higher hospital volume was associated with increased mortality in the analyses adjusted for potential confounders (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-patient increase 1.04, 95\% CI 1.00–1.07). There was a trend toward a lower mortality rate in higher-volume hospitals after treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, but this was not statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounders (HR per 10-patient increase 0.69, 95\% CI 0.42–1.10). There were large variations in mortality after treatment for both ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms across hospitals and between the Scandinavian countries (p {\textless} 0.01).
Conclusions  The findings in this study did not confirm a relationship between higher hospital volume and reduced long-term mortality after treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—The ideal timing of coiling or clipping after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is unknown. Within the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial we assessed differences in incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia and clinical outcome between different timings of treatment.
Methods—The treated 2106 patients randomized to coiling or clipping were divided into 4 categories: treatment Ͻ2 days, on days 3 to 4, on days 5 to 10, and Ͼ10 days after the hemorrhage. ORs with 95\% CI were calculated with logistic regression analysis for delayed cerebral ischemia, poor outcome at 2 months, and 1 year for the different timing categories, with treatment Ͻ2 days as reference. Analyses were performed for all patients, and for coiled and clipped patients separately, and were adjusted for baseline characteristics.
Results—Adjusted ORs of delayed cerebral ischemia for treatment on days 5 to 10 were 1.18 (95\% CI, 0.91–1.53) for all patients, 1.68 (95\% CI, 1.17–2.43) after coiling, and 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.54 –1.16) after clipping. ORs for poor outcome at 2 months were 1.16 (95\% CI, 0.89 –1.50) for treatment (clipping and coiling combined) at 3 to 4 days, 1.39 (95\% CI, 1.08 –1.80) for treatment at 5 to 10 days, and 1.84 (95\% CI, 1.36 –2.51) for treatment Ͼ10 days. ORs for coiled and clipped patients separately were in the same range. Results for outcome at 1 year were similar.
Conclusions—Our results support the current practice for early aneurysm treatment in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. The risk for poor outcome was highest when treatment was performed after day 10; postponing treatment in patients who are eligible for treatment between days 5 to 10 after subarachnoid hemorrhage is not recommended.

Only patients in clinical Grades I to III (according to the classification of Hunt and Hess) who were admitted and randomly assigned to a treatment group within 72 hours after the SAH were included in the trial. The patients were randomly assigned to one of three operation groups: acute surgery (AS: 0 to 3 days after the SAH; day of SAH = Day 0), intermediate surgery (IS: 4 to 7 days after the SAH), or late surgery (LS: 8 days to an indefinite time after the SAH). Three patients (4.3\%) in the IS group and six patients (8.6\%) in the LS group died before surgery was undertaken. At 3 months post-SAH, 65 patients (91.5\%) from the AS group were classified as independent compared to 55 (78.6\%) from the IS group and 56 (80.0\%) from the LS group. The management mortality rate in the AS group was 5.6\% compared to 12.9\% in the LS group.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE  Timely aneurysm occlusion and neurointensive care treatment are key principles in the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) to prevent secondary brain injury. Patients with early (EHA) and delayed hospital admission (DHA) were compared in terms of clinical presentation, treatment strategies, aSAH-related complications, and outcome.
METHODS  In this retrospective study, consecutive aSAH patients were treated at a single neurovascular center between 2009 and 2019. Propensity score matching was performed to account for divergent baseline characteristics.
RESULTS  Among 509 included patients, 55 were admitted more than 48 hours after ictus (DHA group). DHA patients were significantly younger (52 ± 11 vs 56 ± 14 years, p = 0.03) and had lower World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies scores (p {\textless} 0.01) than EHA patients. In 54.5\% of the cases, DHA patients presented with neurological deterioration or aggravated symptoms. Propensity score matching revealed a higher vasospastic infarction rate in the DHA group (41.5\%) than in the EHA group (22.6\%) (p = 0.04). A similar portion of patients in both groups achieved favorable outcome at midterm follow-up (77.3\% vs 73.6\%, p = 0.87). DHA patients (62.3\%) received conventional coiling more often than EHA patients (41.5\%) (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS  DHA patients are at an increased risk of cerebral infarction. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art neurointensive care treatment can result in a good clinical outcome. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.2.JNS20148},

	abstract = {Methods. The authors identified studies from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to September 28, 2012, that evaluated outcome in high-volume versus low-volume centers in patients with SAH who were treated by either clipping or endovascular coiling. No language restrictions were set. The compared outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Mortality in studies was pooled in a random effects meta-analysis. Study quality was reported according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.
Results. Four articles were included in this analysis, representing 36,600 patients. The quality of studies was graded low in 3 and very low in 1. Meta-analysis using a random effects model showed a decrease in hospital mortality (OR 0.77 [95\% CI 0.60–0.97]; p = 0.00; I2 = 91\%) in high-volume hospitals treating SAH patients. Sensitivity analysis revealed the relative weight of the 1 low-quality study. Removal of the study with very low quality increased the effect size of the meta-analysis to an OR of 0.68 (95\% CI 0.56–0.84; p = 0.00; I2 = 86\%). The definition of hospital volume differed among studies. Cutoffs and dichotomizations were used as well as division in quartiles. In 1 study, low volume was defined as 9 or fewer patients yearly, whereas in another it was defined as fewer than 30 patients yearly. Similarly, 1 study defined high volume as more than 20 patients annually, and another defined it as more than 50 patients a year. For comparability between studies, recalculation was done with dichotomized data if available. Cross et al., 2003 (low volume ≤ 18, high volume ≥ 19) and Johnston, 2000 (low volume ≤ 31, high volume ≥ 32) provided core data for recalculation. The overall results of this analysis revealed an OR of 0.85 (95\% CI 0.72–0.99; p = 0.00; I2 = 87\%).
Conclusions. Despite the shortcomings of this study, the mortality rate was lower in hospitals with a larger caseload. Limitations of the meta-analysis are the not uniform cutoff values and uncertainty about case mix. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2013.9.JNS13640)},

Unadjusted 48-hour PICU mortality was statistically signiﬁcantly higher for SPT transports (2.04\% vs. 0.070\%, P ¼ .0028). Multiple regressions adjusted for propensity score, illness severity, and PICU site showed no signiﬁcant difference in 48-hour PICU mortality.
Conclusion: No signiﬁcant difference in adjusted 48-hour PICU mortality for children transported by transport team type was discovered.},

Organisational aspects and training for transfers are highlighted, and we have included an expanded section on paediatric transfers. We have also provided a table with suggested blood pressure parameters for the common types of brain injury but acknowledge that there is little evidence for many of our recommendations. These guidelines remain a mix of evidence-based and consensus-based statements. We have received assistance from many organisations representing clinicians who care for these patients, and we believe our views represent the best of current thinking and opinion.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to test the hypothesis that interfacility transport performed by a pediatric critical care specialized team, compared with nonspecialized teams, would be associated with improved survival rates and fewer unplanned events during the transport process.
METHODS: A single-center, prospective, cohort study was performed between January 2001 and September 2002. A total of 1085 infants and children at referral community hospitals with requests for retrieval by the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh transport team were studied; 1021(94\%) were transported by a specialty team and 64 (6\%) by nonspecialized teams. Unplanned events during the transport process and 28-day mortality rates were assessed.
RESULTS: Unplanned events occurred for 55 patients (5\%) and were more common among patients transported by nonspecialized teams (61\% vs 1.5\%). Airway-related events were most common, followed by cardiopulmonary arrest, sustained hypotension, and loss of crucial intravenous access. After adjustment for illness severity, only the use of a nonspecialized team was independently associated with an unplanned event, and death was more common among patients transported by nonspecialized teams (23\% vs 9\%).
CONCLUSION: Transport of critically ill children to a pediatric tertiary care center can be conducted more safely with a pediatric critical care specialized team than with teams lacking speciﬁc training and expertise in pediatric critical care and pediatric transport medicine.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies from selected centers have shown that early surgical treatment of aneurysms in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients can improve outcomes. These results have not been validated in clinical practice at large.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors and outcomes associated with timing of ruptured intracranial aneurysm obliteration treatment in patients with SAH after hospitalization in the United States.
METHODS: We analyzed the data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005-2008) for all patients presenting with primary diagnosis of SAH, receiving aneurysm treatment (endovascular coil embolization or surgical clip placement). Early treatment was defined as aneurysm treatment performed within 48 hours and delayed treatment if treatment was performed after 48 hours of admission.
RESULTS: Of 32 048 patients with SAH who underwent aneurysm treatment, 24 085 (75.2\%) underwent early treatment and 7963 (24.8\%) underwent delayed treatment. Female sex (P = .002), endovascular embolization (P , .001), and weekday admission (P , .001) were independent predictors of early treatment. In the early treatment group, patients were more likely discharged with none to minimal disability (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-1.47) and less likely to be discharged with moderate to severe disability (OR 0.77, 95\%CI 0.67-0.87) compared with those in the delayed treatment group. The in-hospital mortality was higher in the early treatment group compared with the delayed treatment group (OR 1.36 95\%CI 1.12-1.66).
CONCLUSION: Patients with SAH who undergo aneurysm treatment within 48 hours of hospital admission are more likely to be discharged with none to minimal disability. Early treatment is more likely to occur in those undergoing endovascular treatment and in patients admitted on weekdays.},

All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups were also included in regression analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 17 412 patients were directly admitted to a hospital following nontraumatic SAH where they underwent intervention (clipping/coiling).

Patients who underwent treatment on day 0 had significantly more routine discharge dispositions than those treated {\textgreater}admission day 0 (P {\textless} .0001). In regression analysis, treatment on day 0 was protective against other than routine discharge disposition outcome (P {\textless} .0001; odds ratio 0.657; 95\% confidence interval 0.614-0.838). Total cost incurred by hospitals was \$4.36 billion. Mean cost of hospital charges in the ultra-early cohort was \$239 126.05, which was significantly lower than that for the cohort treated {\textgreater}day 0 (\$272 989.56, P {\textless} .001), Mann-Whitney U-test). Performance of an intervention on admission day 0 was protective against higher hospitalization cost (P {\textless} .0001; odds ratio 0.811; 95\% confidence interval 0.732-0.899).
CONCLUSION: Ultra-early treatment of ruptured aneurysms is significantly associated with better discharge disposition and decreased hospitalization cost.},

We sought to determine the impact of proximity to the accepting neurosurgical centre on outcomes following aneurysmal SAH. Methods: Using administrative data, we analyzed patients undergoing treatment for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage at neurosurgical centres in Ontario between 1995 and 2004. We compared mortality for patients receiving treatment at a centre in their county (in-county) versus those treated from outside counties (out-of-county). We also examined the impact of distance from the patient’s residence to the treating centre. Results: The mortality rates were significantly lower for in-county versus out-of-county patients (23.5\% vs. 27.6\%, p=0.009). This advantage remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders (HR=0.84, p=0.01). The relationship between distance from the treating centre and mortality was biphasic. Under 300km, mortality increased with increasing distance. Over 300km, a survival benefit was observed. Conclusions: Proximity to the treating neurosurgical centre impacts survival after aneurysmal SAH. These results have significant implications for the triage of these critically ill patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Rebleeding is a serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhaging. To date, there are conflicting data regarding the factors contributing to rebleeding and their significance.
Methods: A systematic review of PubMed and Embase databases was conducted for studies pertaining to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and rebleeding in order to assess the associated risk factors. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from fourteen studies comprised of a total of 5693 patients that met the inclusion criteria.
Results: Higher rebleeding rates were observed , 6 h after the initial aSAH (OR = 3.22, 95\% CI = 1.46–7.12), and were associated with high systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.93, 95\% CI = 1.31–2.83), poor Hunt-Hess grade (III–IV) (OR = 3.43, 95\% CI = 2.33–5.05), intracerebral or intraventricular hematomas (OR = 1.65, 95\% CI = 1.33–2.05), posterior circulation aneurysms (OR = 2.15, 95\% CI = 1.32–3.49), and aneurysms .10 mm in size (OR = 1.70, 95\% CI = 1.35–2.14).
Conclusions: Aneurysmal rebleeding occurs more frequently within the first 6 hours after the initial aSAH. Risk factors associated with rebleeding include high systolic pressure, the presence of an intracerebral or intraventricular hematoma, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm .10 mm in size.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE  Most patients suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) initially present to a hospital that lacks a neurosurgical unit. These patients require interhospital transfer (IHT) to tertiary facilities capable of multidisciplinary neurosurgical intervention. Yet, little is known about the effects of IHT on the outcomes of patients suffering from aSAH. In this study, the authors examined the effects of IHT and transport method on the timing of treatment, rebleed rates, and overall outcomes of patients who have experienced aSAH.
METHODS  A retrospective review of medical records identified all consecutive patients who presented with aSAH at an outside hospital and subsequently underwent IHT to a tertiary aneurysm care center and patients who initially presented directly to a tertiary aneurysm care facility between 2008 and 2015. Demographic, operative, radiological, hospital of initial evaluation, transfer method, and outcome data were retrospectively collected.
RESULTS  The authors identified 763 consecutive patients who were evaluated for aSAH at a tertiary aneurysm care facility either directly or following IHT. For patients who underwent IHT and after accounting for these patients’ clinical variability and dichotomizing the patients into groups transferred less than 20 miles and more than 20 miles, the authors noted a significant increase in mortality rates: 7\% ({\textless} 20 miles) and 18.8\% ({\textgreater} 20 miles) (p = 0.004). The increased mortality rate was partially explained by an increased rate of initial presentation to an accredited stroke center in patients undergoing IHT of less than 20 miles (p = 0.000). The method of transport (ground or air ambulance) was found to have significant effect on the patients’ outcomes as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale score (p = 0.021); patients who underwent ground transport demonstrated a higher likelihood of discharge to home (p = 0.004). The increased severity of presentation in the patient cohort undergoing IHT by air as defined by the Glasgow Coma Scale score, a need for an external ventricular drain, Hunt and Hess grade, and intubation status at presentation did not result in increased mortality when compared with the ground cohort (p = 0.074). In addition, there was an 8-hour increase in duration of time from admission to treatment for the air cohort as compared with the ground cohort (p = 0.054), indicating a potential for further improvement in the overall outcome of this patient group.
CONCLUSIONS  Aneurysmal SAH remains a challenging neurosurgical disease process requiring highly coordinated care in tertiary referral centers. In this study, the overall distance traveled and the transport method affected patient outcomes. The time from admission to treatment should continue to improve. Further analysis of IHT with a focus on patient monitoring and treatment during transport is warranted. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2016.9.JNS16668 KEY WORDS  aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; interhospital transfer; outcomes; vascular disorders},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating type of stroke associated with high morbidity and mortality. One of the most feared complications is an early rebleeding before aneurysm repair. Predictors for such an often fatal rebleeding are largely unknown. We therefore aimed to determine predictors for an early rebleeding after aSAH in relation with time after ictus.
Methods—This observational prospective cohort study included all consecutive patients admitted with aSAH between January 1998 and December 2014 (n=1337) at our University Neurovascular Center. Clinical predictors for rebleeding ≤24 hours were identified using multivariable Cox regression analyses. Kaplan–Meier analyses were applied to evaluate the time of rebleeding ≤72 hours after aSAH.
Results—A modified Fisher grade of 3 to 4 was a predictor for an in-hospital rebleeding ≤24 hours after ictus (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.4; 95\% confidence interval, 2.1–10.6; P{\textless}0.001). The numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 rebleeding ≤24 hours was calculated 15 (95\% confidence interval, 10–25). Also, the initiation of external cerebrospinal fluiddrainage (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.9; 95\% confidence interval, 1.4–2.5; P{\textless}0.001) was independently associated with a rebleeding ≤24 hours. Cumulative in-hospital rebleeding rates were 5.8\% ≤24 hours, and 1.2\% in the time frame 24–72 hours after ictus.
Conclusions—In our opinion, timing of treatment of aSAH patients, especially those with an modified Fisher grade of 3 or 4 in a good clinical condition, should be reconsidered. These aSAH patients might be regarded a medical emergency, requiring aneurysm repair as soon as possible. In this respect, our findings should provoke the debate on timing of aneurysm repair, especially in patients considered to be at high risk for rebleeding.  ( Stroke. 2015;46:2100-2106.

	abstract = {Objectives: This observational study determined frequency and describes all-cause adverse event epidemiology in a large air medical transport system.
Methods: Records of a mandatory reporting system were reviewed and a data set containing all of the patient care records was searched to identify aviation- and non–aviation-related adverse events. Two reviewers independently identiﬁed adverse events and categorized them using an established taxonomy. Descriptive statistics were used to report adverse events, with frequency calculated per 1,000 ﬂights and 1,000 hours ﬂown.
Results: Between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2005, there were 1,447 reports, of which 598 included an adverse event. Case-ﬁnding identiﬁed an additional 125. A complete report was available in 680 of 723 (94.1\%) events. There were 58,956 ﬂights and 103,632 hours ﬂown during the study period, for a rate of 11.53 adverse events per 1,000 ﬂights (95\% CI = 10.7 to 12.4 adverse events) or 6.56 per 1,000 hours ﬂown (95\% CI = 6.1 to 7.1 adverse events). The frequencies of events by category were as follows: communication (229; 33.7\%), transport vehicle (143; 21.0\%), medical equipment (88; 12.9\%), patient management (77; 11.4\%), clinical performance (68; 10.0\%), weather (30; 4.4\%), unclassiﬁed (24; 3.5\%), and patient factors causing death (21; 3.1\%). There was possible patient harm in 117 events.
Conclusions: Air medical transport is associated with a low incidence of adverse events and possible patient harm. Communication problems were the most common cause of an event. Determining event epidemiology is necessary to identify modiﬁable factors, propose solutions to decrease the adverse events, and direct future efforts to improve safety.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In order to minimize the additional risk of interhospital transport of critically ill patients, we started a mobile intensive care unit (MICU) with a specialized retrieval team, reaching out from our university hospital-based intensive care unit to our adherence region in March 2009. To evaluate the effects of this implementation, we performed a prospective audit comparing adverse events and patient stability during MICU transfers with our previous data on transfers performed by standard ambulance.
Methods: All transfers performed by MICU from March 2009 until December 2009 were included. Data on 14 vital variables were collected at the moment of departure, arrival and 24 hours after admission. Variables before and after transfer were compared using the paired-sample T-test. Major deterioration was expressed as a variable beyond a predefined critical threshold and was analyzed using the McNemar test and the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Results were compared to the data of our previous prospective study on interhospital transfer performed by ambulance.
Results: A total of 74 interhospital transfers of ICU patients over a 10-month period were evaluated. An increase of total number of variables beyond critical threshold at arrival, indicating a worsening of condition, was found in 38 percent of patients. Thirty-two percent exhibited a decrease of one or more variables beyond critical threshold and 30\% showed no difference. There was no correlation between patient status at arrival and the duration of transfer or severity of disease. ICU mortality was 28\%. Systolic blood pressure, glucose and haemoglobin were significantly different at arrival compared to departure, although significant values for major deterioration were never reached. Compared to standard ambulance transfers of ICU patients, there were less adverse events: 12.5\% vs. 34\%, which in the current study were merely caused by technical (and not medical) problems. Although mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was significantly higher, patients transferred by MICU showed less deterioration in pulmonary parameters during transfer than patients transferred by standard ambulance.
Conclusions: Transfer by MICU imposes less risk to critically ill patients compared to transfer performed by standard ambulance and has, therefore, resulted in an improved quality of interhospital transport of ICU patients in the north-eastern part of the Netherlands.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Interhospital transport of critically ill patients is at risk of complications. The objective of the study was to prospectively record patient safety incidents that occurred during interhospital transports and to determine their risk factors.
Methods: We prospectively collected data during a ﬁfteen-month period in 2 hospitals. Patient and transport characteristics were collected using a speciﬁcally designed tool. Patient safety incidents were appraised for health-care associated harm, and categorized as technical, operational, and communication problems.
Results: Our study included 688 patients who were transferred to or from one of both hospitals by physician or nurse led transport, with complete records. A patient safety incident was reported in 16.7\% of transports, health-care associated harm was noted in 3.9\% of cases. In multivariate analysis, three factors remained signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of healthcare-associated harm: operational incidents (odds ratio = 144.93, 95\% CI = 37.55–767.50, P {\textless} 0.001), communication incidents (odds ratio = 11.05, 95\% CI = 3.02–52.99, P {\textless} 0.001) and the Modiﬁed Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (M-SOFA) score (odds ratio = 1.198, 95\% CI = 1.038–1.40, P = 0.017).
Conclusions: The observed rate of patient safety incidents during interhospital transfers is lower than previously reported in the literature. However, there is limited previous work done on this topic. Operational and communication incidents, and a higher M-SOFA score are signiﬁcantly associated with increase odds of harmful incident. These ﬁndings call for stricter preparation of transfers, with clear and standardized communication.},

	abstract = {Purpose:  Regionalization and concentration of critical care increases the need for interhospital transport. However, optimal staffing of ground critical care transport has not been evaluated.
Methods:  In this prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint non-inferiority trial, critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation transported by interhospital ground critical care transport were randomized between transport staffed by a dedicated team comprising a critical care nurse and paramedic (nurses group) or a dedicated team including a critical care physician (nurses + physician group). The primary outcome was the number of patients with critical events, both clinical and technical, during transport. Clinical events included decrease in blood pressure, oxygen saturation, or temperature, blood loss, new cardiac arrhythmias, or death. Non-inferiority was assumed if the upper limit of the two-sided 90 \% confidence interval (CI) for the between-group difference lies below the non-inferiority margin of 3 \%.
Results:  Of 618 eligible transported critically ill patients, 298 could be analyzed after randomization and allocation to the nurses group (n = 147) or nurses + physician group (n = 151). The percentages of patients with critical events were 16.3 \% (24 incidents in 147 transports) in the nurses group and 15.2 \% (23 incidents in 151 transports) in the nurses + physician group (difference 1.1 \%, two-sided 90 \% CI [−5.9 to 8.1]). Critical events occurred in both groups at a higher than the expected (0–1 \%) rate. In the nurses group consultations for physician assistance were requested in 8.2 \% (12 in 147 transports), all of which were performed prior to transport.
Conclusions:  The number of patients with critical events did not markedly differ between critical care transports staffed by a critical care nurse and paramedic compared to a team including a critical care physician.

	abstract = {Objective: Patient safety events (PSEs) occurring during interfacility transport have not been studied comprehensively in critical care transport (CCT) teams in the United States. The purpose of this research was to investigate the type and frequency of PSEs during CCT between hospitals; to explore the impact of patient stability, vulnerability, complexity, predictability, and resiliency; and to examine if the nurse factors of licensure or experience and transport factors of duration or mode of transport inﬂuence the frequency of PSEs. The study was conducted at a large hospital-based quaternary health care system in the Midwestern United States.
Methods: This was a retrospective, descriptive correlational study using chart review. The study selected 50 sequential qualifying cases with PSEs and randomly selected control cases reviewed at a single site over a 5-month period.
Results: The rate of PSEs was 27.7 events per 1,000 patient contacts. Of 9 reported adverse event types, new or recurrent hypoxia had the greatest frequency. Hypoxia, when present at the time of initial CCT contact, was associated with the PSE occurrence (P = .046). Duration of transport was a signiﬁcant predictor of PSEs (P = .025).
Conclusion: Pretransport hypoxia and duration of transport are independent predictors for intratransport PSEs, particularly intratransport hypoxia. Copyright © 2018 Air Medical Journal Associates. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Methods: Searching PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases until February 12, 2021, we included studies that a priori deﬁned AEs for adult medical patients. We excluded case reports, non−full-text, and non−English language studies. We performed a random effects meta-analysis and moderator analyses.
Results: We identiﬁed 554 studies and included 19 studies (14,969 patients) in our ﬁnal analysis. The mean patients’ (standard deviation) age was 60 (13.7). The pooled medical AEs for IHT was 1,059 (11\%, 95\% conﬁdence interval, 7.5\%-16\%). The most common AE (n, \%) was hypotension (424, 2.8\%). Moderator analyses and meta-regressions suggested that conditions (P {\textless} .001) such as respiratory failure from coronavirus infection (88\%), stroke (19\%), and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (40\%) were associated with higher AE prevalence. Transport by nurses (31\%) and physicians (11\%) was associated with a higher AE prevalence, whereas transport type did not inﬂuence AE prevalence.
Conclusion: Our study suggests the prevalence of AEs of critically ill patients during IHT is low and likely due to patients’ disease severity. Further studies should focus on interventions to mitigate AEs to improve patients’ outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objective: We assessed the mortality risk related to the time for intensive care unit transport in a geographically large regional health care system.
Methods: Patient-level data from critical care ambulance missions were analyzed for 2,067 cases, mission time, and relevant patient factors. Mission time was used as a surrogate for the “distance” to tertiary care, and mortality at 7 days and other intervals was assessed.
Results: No increased mortality risk was found at 7 days in an unadjusted regression analysis (odds ratio = 1.00; range, 0.999-1.002; P = .66). In a secondary analysis, an increased mortality risk was observed in longer mission time subgroups and at later mortality assessment intervals ({\textgreater} 375 mission minutes and 90-day mortality; adjusted hazard ratio = 1.56; range, 1.07-2.28; P = .02). Negative changes in oxygenation and hemodynamic status and transport-related adverse events were associated with the longest ﬂight times. Measurable but small changes during ﬂight were noted for mean arterial pressure and oxygenation.
Conclusion: The main ﬁnding was that there was no overall difference in mortality risk based on mission time. We conclude that transport distances or accessibility to critical care in the tertiary care center in a geographically large but sparsely populated region is not clearly associated with mortality risk. © 2021 The Authors.

Currently large, and increasing, numbers of critically ill patients require transfer between critical care units. Inter-unit transfer poses significant risks to critically ill patients, particularly those requiring multiple organ support. While the safety and quality of inter-unit and hospital transfers appear to have improved over the years, the effectiveness of specific measures to improve safety have not been confirmed by randomized controlled trials. It is generally accepted that critically ill patients should be transferred by specialized retrieval teams, but the composition, training and assessment of these teams is still a matter of debate.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether trauma patients should be transferred initially to a trauma center or local hospital.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the evidence for direct transport to specialist centers (SCs) versus initial stabilization at non-SCs (NSCs) for major trauma or moderate-to-severe head injury. Nine databases were searched from 1988 to 2012. Limitations in the study design informed recommendations for future studies.
RESULTS: Of 19 major trauma studies, ﬁve (n = 19,910) included patients not transferred to SCs and adjusted for case mix. Meta-analysis showed no difference in mortality for initial triage to NSCs versus SCs (odds ratio [OR] 1.03; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI], 0.85Y1.23). Within studies excluding patients not transferred to SCs, unadjusted analyses of mortality nonsigniﬁcantly favored transfer via NSCs (16 studies; n = 37,079; OR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.68Y1.01), whereas adjusted analysis nonsigniﬁcantly favored direct triage to SCs (9 studies; n = 34,266; OR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.96Y1.44). Of 11 head injury studies, all excluded patients not transferred to SCs and half were in remote locations. There was no signiﬁcant mortality difference between initial triage to NSCs versus SCs within adjusted analyses (3 studies; n = 1,507; OR, 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.31Y1.79) or unadjusted analyses (10 studies; n = 3,671; OR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.62Y1.23).

This study investigated the impact of direct versus nondirect transfers on the mortality rates of patients with sTBI.
Methods: Data on patients with TBI admitted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, to our Level I TC were obtained from the trauma registry. Data included patient age, sex, mechanism, and type of injury, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity scores, prehospital time, time to request and to transfer, time to initiation of multimodality monitoring and goal-directed therapy protocol, dwell time in the emergency department (EDT), and mortality. Data, reported in means Æ standard deviation, were analyzed with the Student t-test and chi-square. Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted at a P value {\textless} 0.05.
Results: sTBI direct transfer to TC versus transfer from non-TCs (NTC): Of the 1187 patients with TBI admitted to our TC, 768 (64.7\%) were admitted directly from the scene, whereas 419 (35.3\%) were admitted after secondary transfer. One hundred seventy-one (22.2\%) of the direct transfers had Glasgow Coma Scale {\textless} 8 (sTBI) and 92 (21.9\%) of the secondary transfers had sTBI. The transfer time: Time from scene to arrival to the EDT was signiﬁcantly shorter for TC versus NTCs 43 Æ 14 versus 77 Æ 26 min, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). EDT dwell time before transfer and time from injury to arrival to TC were 4.2 Æ 2.1 and 6.2 Æ 8.3 h, respectively. Mortality: There was a statistically signiﬁcant lower mortality for patients with sTBI transferred directly from the scene to TCs as opposed to patients secondarily transferred, 33/171 (19.3\%) versus 33/92 (35.8\%), respectively (P {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: To decrease TBI-related mortality, patients with suspected sTBI should be taken directly to a Level I or II TC unless they require life-saving stabilization at NTCs. ª 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives: After rural injury, evaluation at local hospitals with transfer to regional trauma centres may delay definitive care. This study sought to determine the impact of such delays on outcomes in patients with TBI within a mature regional trauma system.
Methods: The ETMC Level 1 Trauma registry was queried from 2008–2013 for patients with blunt TBI, aged ≥ 18 and admitted ≤ 24 hours from injury and stratified them as ‘transfer’ vs ‘direct’ admission. Demographics, transfer distance, transfer times and outcomes were compared using Chi-square, t-test and multivariable logistic regression; p {\textless} 0.05 was significant.
Results: During the study period, 1845 patients met inclusion criteria: 947 ‘direct’ and 898 ‘transfers’. For transfers, median distance was 60.1 miles; mean time to initial care was 1.2 ± 2.7 hours and time to Level 1 care was 5.0 ± 2.4 hours. Transfer patients were older (56 vs 49 years; p {\textless} 0.01) and had more comorbidities, but had lower mean ISS (15.9 vs 18.8; p {\textless} 0.01) and lower mortality (7.0 vs 10.3\%; p {\textless} 0.03), complications and LOS. Neurosurgical intervention was comparable (p = 0.88), as was mortality for patients with ISS ≥ 15 (12.4\% vs 14.8\%; p = 0.28). After regression analysis, advanced age and increasing ISS, not distance or time, predicted mortality.
Conclusion: Neither transfer distance nor time independently contributed to mortality for TBI after rural injury. An established regional trauma system, with initial local stabilization using ATLS principles, may help reduce negative outcomes for injured patients in rural settings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Within a trauma network in the Netherlands, neurosurgical facilities are usually limited to Level I hospitals. Initial transport to a district hospital of patients who are later found to require neurosurgical intervention may cause delay. The purpose of this study was to assess the inﬂuence on outcome and time intervals of secondary transfer in trauma patients requiring emergency neurosurgical intervention.
METHODS: In a 3-year period, all patients who sustained a severe traumatic brain injury and underwent a neurosurgical intervention within 6 hours after admission to a Level I trauma center were included. Patients were classiﬁed into two groups: direct presentation to the Level I trauma center (TC) group or requiring secondary transport after having been diagnosed for neurosurgical intervention in other hospitals (transfer group).
RESULTS: Eighty patients were included for analyses. Twenty-four patients in the transfer group had a better Glasgow Coma Scale on-scene but a higher 30-day mortality compared with patients who were primarily presented to the Level I trauma center (33\% vs. 27\%; p ϭ 0.553). In the transfer group, time to operation was 304 minutes compared with 151 minutes in the TC group (p Ͻ 0.001). Most delay occurred during the initial trauma evaluation and the interval between the ﬁrst computed tomography and the transfer ambulance departure at the referring hospital.
CONCLUSION: Patients requiring an emergency neurosurgical intervention appear to have a clinically relevant worse outcome after secondary transfer to a neurosurgical service. Therefore, patient care can probably be improved by better triage on-scene and standardized procedures in case of a secondary transfer. (J Trauma. 2012;72: 487– 490.

	abstract = {Background:
              Secondary transports of patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) may result in a delayed management and neurosurgical intervention, which is potentially detrimental. The aim of this study was to study the effect of triaging and delayed transfers on outcome, specifically studying time to diagnostics and neurosurgical management.
            
            
              Methods:
              This was a retrospective observational cohort study of TBI patients in need of neurosurgical care, 15 years and older, in the Stockholm Region, Sweden, from 2008 throughout 2014. Data were collected from pre-hospital and in-hospital charts. Known TBI outcome predictors, including the protein biomarker of brain injury S100B, were used to assess injury severity. Characteristics and outcomes of direct trauma center (TC) and those of secondary transfers were evaluated and compared. Functional outcome, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale, was assessed in survivors at 6–12 months after trauma. Regression models, including propensity score balanced models, were used for endpoint assessment.
            
            
              Results:
              A total of
              n
              = 457 TBI patients were included;
              n
              = 320 (70\%) patients were direct TC transfers, whereas
              n
              = 137 (30\%) were secondary referrals. In all,
              n
              = 295 required neurosurgery for the first 24 h after trauma (about 75\% of each subgroup). Direct TC transfers were more severely injured (median Glasgow Coma Scale 8 vs. 13) and more often suffered a high energy trauma (31 vs. 2.9\%) than secondary referrals. Admission S100B was higher in the TC transfer group, though S100B levels 12–36 h after trauma were similar between cohorts. Direct or indirect TC transfer could be predicted using propensity scoring. The secondary referrals had a shorter distance to the primary hospital, but had later radiology and surgery than the TC group (all
              p
              \&lt; 0.001). In adjusted multivariable analyses with and without propensity matching, direct or secondary transfers were not found to be significantly related to outcome. Time from trauma to surgery did not affect outcome.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              TBI patients secondary transported to a TC had surgical intervention performed hours later, though this did not affect outcome, presumably demonstrating that accurate pre-hospital triaging was performed. This indicates that for selected patients, a wait-and-see approach with delayed neurosurgical intervention is not necessarily detrimental, but warrants further research.},

Methods We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane database, EMBASE and Web of Science to identify studies for inclusion. The measures of effect utilised were unadjusted/adjusted ORs. Effect estimates were combined using random effects models for each outcome ( poor outcome, case fatality); heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 index. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to account for heterogeneity and risk of bias.
Results 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Treatment {\textless}1 day was associated with a reduced odds of poor outcome compared with treatment {\textgreater}1 day (OR=0.40 (95\% CI 0.28 to 0.56; I2=0\%)) but not when compared with treatment at 1–3 days (OR=1.16 (95\% CI 0.47 to 2.90; I2=81\%)). Treatment at {\textless}2 days and at {\textless}3 days were associated with similar odds of poor outcome compared with later treatment (OR=1.20 (95\% CI 0.70 to 2.05; I2=73\%; OR=0.71 (95\% CI 0.36 to 1.37; I2=71\%)). Early treatment was associated with similar odds of case fatality compared with later treatment, regardless of how early/late treatment were deﬁned (OR=1.80 (95\% CI 0.88 to 3.67; I2=34\%) for treatment {\textless}1 day vs days 1–3; OR=1.71 (95\% CI 0.72 to 4.03; I2=54\%) for treatment {\textless}2 days vs later; OR=0.90 (95\% CI 0.31 to 2.68; I2=48\%) for treatment {\textless}3 days vs later).
Conclusions In only 1 of the analyses was there a statistically signiﬁcant result, which favoured treatment {\textless}1 day. The inconsistent results and heterogeneity within most analyses highlight the lack of evidence for best timing of endovascular treatment in SAH patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction—Current guidelines for management of critically ill stroke patients suggest that treatment in a neurocritical care unit (NCCU) and/or by a neurointensivist (NI) may be beneficial, but the contribution of each to outcome is unknown. The relative impact of a NCCU vs. NI on short- and long-term outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was assessed.
Methods—2,096 stroke patients admitted to a NCCU or non-neuro ICU at a tertiary stroke center were analyzed before the appointment of a NI, during the NI’s tenure, and after the NI departed and was not replaced. Data included admission ICU type, availability of a NI, age, NIHSS, ICH score and 3 and 12 month outcome.
Results—For AIS, compared to the time interval with a NI, departure of the NI predicted a worse rate of return to pre-stroke function at 3 months. For ICH, NCCU treatment predicted shorter ICU and hospital LOS but had no effect on short or long term outcomes. No effect of a NI was seen. For SAH, availability of an NI (but not an NCCU) predicted improved outcomes but longer ICU LOS. Disposition and in-hospital mortality improved when a NI was present, but continued improvement did not occur after the NI’s departure.
Conclusion—Presence of an NI was associated with improved clinical outcomes. This effect was more evident in patients with SAH. Patients with ICH tend to have poor outcomes regardless of the presence of a NCCU or a NI.},

	abstract = {Background: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a life-threatening disease requiring neurocritical care. Delayed cerebral ischemia is a well-known complication that contributes to unfavorable neurological outcomes. Cerebral vasospasm has been thought to be the main cause of delayed cerebral ischemia, and although several studies were able to decrease cerebral vasospasm, none showed improved neurological outcomes. Our target is not cerebral vasospasm but improving neurological outcomes. The purpose of this review is to discuss what intensivists should know and can do to improve clinical outcomes in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. Main body of the abstract: Delayed cerebral ischemia is thought to be due to not only vasospasm but also multifactorial mechanisms. Additionally, the concept of early brain injury, which occurs within the first 72 h after the hemorrhage, has become an important concern. Increasing sympathetic activity after the hemorrhage is associated with cardiopulmonary complications and poor outcomes. Serum lactate measurement may be a valuable marker reflecting the severity of sympathetic activity. The transpulmonary thermodilution method will bring about an advanced understanding of hemodynamic management. Fever is a well-recognized symptom and targeted temperature management is an anticipated intervention. To avoid hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, performing moderate glucose control and minimizing glucose variability are important concepts in glycemic management, but the optimal target range remains unknown. Dysnatremia seems to be associated with negative outcomes. It is not clear yet that maintaining normonatremia actively improves neurological outcomes. Optimal duration of intensive care management has not been determined. Short conclusion: Although we have an advanced understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of subarachnoid hemorrhage, there are many controversies in the intensive care unit management of subarachnoid hemorrhage. With an awareness of not only delayed cerebral ischemia but also early brain injury, more attention should be given to various aspects to improve neurological outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most important cause for a poor clinical outcome after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to assess whether goal-directed hemodynamic therapy (GDHT), as compared to standard clinical care, reduces the rate of DCI after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients {\textgreater}18 years of age with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were enrolled and randomly assigned to standard therapy or GDHT. Advanced hemodynamic monitoring and predefined GDHT algorithms were applied in the GDHT group. The primary end point was the occurrence of DCI. Functional outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 3 months after discharge.
RESULTS: In total, 108 patients were randomized to the control (n=54) or GDHT group (n=54). The primary outcome (DCI) occurred in 13\% of the GDHT group and in 32\% of the control group patients (odds ratio, 0.324 [95\% CI, 0.11–0.86]; P=0.021). Even after adjustment for confounding parameters, GDHT was found to be superior to standard therapy (hazard ratio, 2.84 [95\% CI, 1.18–6.86]; P=0.02). The GOS was assessed 3 months after discharge in 107 patients; it showed more patients with a low disability (GOS 5, minor or no deficits) than patients with higher deficits (GOS 1–4) in the GDHT group compared with the control group (GOS 5, 66\% versus 44\%; GOS 1–4, 34\% versus 56\%; P=0.025). There was no significant difference in mortality between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: GDHT reduced the rate of DCI after subarachnoid hemorrhage with a better functional outcome (GOS=5) 3 months after discharge.},

	abstract = {Objectives The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of the introduction of an integrated adult critical care patient retrieval system in Victoria, Australia, on early clinical outcomes for major trauma patients who undergo interhospital transfer. The secondary aims were to examine the impact on quality and process measures for interhospital transfers in this population, and on longer-term patient-reported outcomes.
Methods This is a cohort study using data contained in the Victorian State Trauma Registry (VSTR) for major trauma patients {\textgreater}18 years of age between 2009 and 2013 who had undergone interhospital transfer. For eligible patients, data items were extracted from the VSTR for analysis: demographics, injury details, hospital details, transfer details, Adult Retrieval Victoria (ARV) coordination indicator and transfer indicator, key clinical observations and outcomes.
Results There were 3009 major trauma interhospital transfers in the state with a transfer time less than 24 h. ARV was contacted for 1174 (39.0\%) transfers. ARVcoordinated metropolitan transfers demonstrated lower adjusted odds of inhospital mortality compared with metropolitan transfers occurring without ARV coordination (OR 0.39, 0.15 to 0.97). Adjusting for destination hospital type demonstrates that this impact was principally due to ARV facilitation of a Major Trauma Service as the destination for transferred patients (OR 0.41, 0.16 to 1.02). The median time spent at the referral hospital was lower for ARV-coordinated transfers (5.4 h (3.8 to 7.5) vs 6.1 (4.2 to 9.2), p{\textless}0.0001).
Conclusions In a mature trauma system, an effective retrieval service can further reduce mortality and improve long-term outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objective: Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) require management in centers with neurosurgical expertise necessitating emergent interhospital transfer (IHT). Our objective was to compare outcomes in aSAH IHTs to our institution with aSAH admissions from our institutional emergency department (ED).
Methods: Data for consecutive patients with aSAH admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions between 1991 and 2009 were analyzed from a prospectively obtained database. We compared inhospital mortality and functional outcomes at first clinical appointment post-aSAH (30-120 days) using dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (good outcome: Glasgow Outcome Scale 4-5) in ED admissions with IHTs.
Results: A total of 1134 consecutive patients with aSAH were included in analysis (ED 40.1\%, IHT 59.9\%). Direct ED admissions had a higher incidence of poor Hunt and Hess grade (4/5) and major medical comorbidities, with no significant differences between the 2 groups in age, intraventricular hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus. In-hospital mortality for ED admissions (14.9\%) was significantly lower than that for IHTs (20.5\%), with 1.8 times greater adjusted odds of survival after multivariate analysis (P = .001). Emergency department admissions had nearly 2-fold greater odds of good outcomes (odds ratio, 1.89; P b .001) after multivariate analysis.
Conclusions: Our institutional ED SAH admissions had significantly better outcomes than did IHTs, suggesting that delays in optimizing care before transfer could deleteriously impact outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the association between transport intervals (including time from call to arrival of transport team at the sending hospital, time spent by the transport team in the sending hospital, and transport time between the sending and receiving hospital) and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay and hospital mortality at the receiving hospital. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, stratified cohort study involving all patients 15 years and older who were transferred from one hospital to another of equal or larger size in British Columbia, Canada, and who spent at least 1 day in an ICU or coronary care unit (CCU) at the receiving hospital during 1999 (n = 1930). Data were obtained from 6 administrative databases and linked using generalized software.
Results: After adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity, and diagnostic group, longer time from call to arrival of paramedics at the sending hospital was associated with a shorter length of ICU/CCU stay (rate ratio [RR], 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.97) for survivors and a longer length of hospital (RR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.21) and ICU/CCU (RR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.25) stay for nonsurvivors in the higher-priority air transport group, and with a slightly shorter length of hospital stay (RR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.95-0.99) for all patients in the lower-priority air transport group. Longer time spent by paramedics at the sending hospital was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (RR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.650.96) for survivors in the higher-priority air transport group. Longer time for transport between the sending and receiving hospitals was associated with a longer length of ICU/CCU stay (RR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.26-2.27) for survivors in the higher-priority air transport group but a slightly shorter length of ICU/ CCU stay (RR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.95-0.99) for all patients in the ground transport group. There were no associations between transport times and hospital mortality.
Conclusions: Transport intervals are independently associated with ICU/CCU and hospital lengths of stay at the receiving hospital for critically ill adults transferred to referral centers. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), aneurysm treatment as early as feasible is mandatory to minimize the risk of a rebleed and may thus improve outcome. We assessed the different time intervals from the ﬁrst symptoms of aSAH to start of aneurysm treatment in an effort to identify which factors contribute mostly to a delay in time to treatment. In 278 aSAH patients, time intervals between the different steps from initial hemorrhage to aneurysm treatment were retrospectively reviewed, and delaying factors were determined. Half of the patients presented to a hospital within 115 min (IQR 60–431). The median (IQR) interval from hemorrhage to diagnosis was 169 min (96–513), and from diagnosis to treatment 1,057 min (416–1,428), or 17.6 h. Aneurysm treatment started within 24 h in 76 \% of treated patients. Independent factors predicting delay to treatment were primary presentation at a referring hospital and admission to the treatment center later in the day. Delay in treatment was not independently related to poor outcome. The interval to aneurysm treatment might be improved upon by immediate and direct transport to the treatment center combined with optimization of in-hospital logistics, following the ‘time-is-brain’ concept so successfully adopted in the treatment of ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Aim:
              The “2023 Guideline for the Management of Patients With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage” replaces the 2012 “Guidelines for the Management of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.” The 2023 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
            
            
              METHODS:
              A comprehensive search for literature published since the 2012 guideline, derived from research principally involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted between March 2022 and June 2022. In addition, the guideline writing group reviewed documents on related subject matter previously published by the American Heart Association. Newer studies published between July 2022 and November 2022 that affected recommendation content, Class of Recommendation, or Level of Evidence were included if appropriate.
            
            
              Structure:
              Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a significant global public health threat and a severely morbid and often deadly condition. The 2023 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to preventing, diagnosing, and managing patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients’ and their families’ and caregivers’ interests. Many recommendations from the previous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data.},

	abstract = {Background: Incidence estimates of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in Sweden vary, which may be caused by regional variations. Reliable estimates of agespecific case fatality rates are lacking. We analysed regional incidence rates and case fatality rates of SAH in Sweden.
Methods: The Swedish Hospital Discharge and Cause of Death Registries from 1987 to 2002 yielded data on 18 443 patients with SAH. Incidence and case fatality rates by age, gender, region and time period were calculated by Poisson regression.
Results: The incidence rate was 12.4 per 100 000 person-years (95\% CI 12.2 to 12.6) and increased with age, from 6.4/100 000 person-years in patients who were 30–39 years old to 25.8/100 000 person-years in patients who were older than 80 years. Incidence was higher for women (14.4 (95\% CI 14.2 to 14.7)) than for men (10.3 (95\% CI 10.3 to 10.6)), and higher in the north than in the south (RR 1.31 (95\% CI 1.25 to 1.37)). This geographical gradient was more evident in women (RR 1.41 (95\% CI 1.33 to1.49)) than in men (RR 1.23 (95\% CI 1.15 to 1.33)). The 28-day case fatality rate was 31.7\% (95\% CI 31.0 to 32.3). It increased with age from 18.1\% (95\% CI 16.0 to 20.3) in patients who were 30–39 years old to 57.6\% (95\% CI 55.2 to 59.9) in patients over 80 years, then levelling off. Over time (1995–2002 compared with 1987–1994), the incidence rate decreased (RR 0.93 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.96)) and case fatality rate decreased (RR 0.89 (95\% CI 0.85 to 0.93)).
Conclusions: SAH incidence rates in Sweden increase from south to north, more in women than in men. Octogenarians have a quadrupled incidence and a tripled case fatality compared with young adults. During 16 years, both incidence and case fatality have decreased.},

	abstract = {Objective: To create an accurate prediction model using variables collected in widely available health administrative data records to identify hospitalizations for primary subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
Methods: A previously established complete cohort of consecutive primary SAH patients was combined with a random sample of control hospitalizations. Chi-square recursive partitioning was used to derive and internally validate a model to predict the probability that a patient had primary SAH (due to aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation) using health administrative data.
Results: A total of 10,322 hospitalizations with 631 having primary SAH (6.1\%) were included in the study (5,122 derivation, 5,200 validation). In the validation patients, our recursive partitioning algorithm had a sensitivity of 96.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 93.9–98.0), a specificity of 99.8\% (95\% CI 99.6–99.9), and a positive likelihood ratio of 483 (95\% CI 254–879). In this population, patients meeting criteria for the algorithm had a probability of 45\% of truly having primary SAH.
Conclusions: Routinely collected health administrative data can be used to accurately identify hospitalized patients with a high probability of having a primary SAH. This algorithm may allow, upon validation, an easy and accurate method to create validated cohorts of primary SAH from either ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.

Limitations: Canadian setting. Tertiary setting. Single center. The authors call for validation in other centers.

Conclusion: An algortihm can identify primary aSAH patients with great certainty using retrospective admission data in a tertiary center in Ontario.
Methods: Using prospectively collected aSAH patients as a target, different predictive models are tested on that target on 10 000 hospital admission. Logistic regression and recursive partitioning are used. 
Results: Using a partitioning algorithm, the predicitions are good. I60 is the most important predictor. Of the patients with I60, 97.5\% will have aSAH. If you add repair or LOS {\textless}48h (i.e. death?), 100\% will have aSAH. Some aSAH patients are identified in non-I60 patients, for example by adding aneurysm repair OR ICH codes + various other makers (cardiovascular disease, urgent admission et cetera).

Methods—A retrospective population based design was employed with multiple overlapping methods of case ascertainment. A strict deﬁnition of subarachnoid haemorrhage was used. Age and sex speciﬁc incidence rates and relative risks for death at diVerent time intervals are calculated.
Results—Eight hundred cases of ﬁrst ever subarachnoid haemorrhage were identiﬁed; 77\% of cases were veriﬁed by CT, 22\% by necropsy, and 1\% by lumbar puncture. The incidence rates are higher than those previously reported in the United Kingdom. The age standardised incidence rate (/100 000 person-years) for females was 11.9 (95\% conﬁdence interval (95\% CI) 9.5–15.0), for males 7.4 (5.4–10.0), and the total rate was 9.7 (7.5–12.6). The case fatality rates at 24 hours, 1 week, and 30 days were 21 (18–24)\%, 37 (33–41)\%, and 44 (40–49)\% respectively.

Results: During 13 704 959 person-years of follow-up, 2659 cases of ﬁrst-ever fatal or non-fatal SAH occurred, with an age-standardized incidence rate of 9.0 [95\% conﬁdence interval (CI) (7.4–10.6)/100 000 person-years] in men and 13.8 [(11.4–16.2)/100 000 person-years] in women. The incidence rate increased exponentially with higher age. In multivariable-adjusted Poisson models, marked sex interactions for current smoking and body mass index (BMI) were observed. Current smoking conferred a rate ratio (RR) of 2.24 (95\% CI 1.95–2.57) in women and 1.62 (1.47–1.79) in men. One standard deviation higher BMI was associated with an RR of 0.86 (0.81–0.92) in women and 1.02 (0.96–1.08) in men. Higher blood pressure and lower education level were also associated with higher risk of SAH.
Conclusions: The risk of SAH is 45\% higher in women than in men, with substantial sex differences in risk factor strengths. In particular, a markedly stronger adverse effect of smoking in women may motivate targeted public health initiatives.},

	abstract = {Objective To study whether the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) varies between geographic regions of Finland.
Methods By utilizing the nationwide Causes of Death and Hospital Discharge Registers, we identiﬁed all ﬁrst-ever, hospitalized, and sudden-death (dying before hospitalization) SAH events in Finland between 1998 and 2017. Based on the patients’ home residence, we divided SAHs into 5 geographic regions: southern, central, western, eastern, and northern Finland. We calculated crude and European age-standardized (European Standard Population [ESP] 2013) SAH incidence rates for each region and used a Poisson regression model to calculate age-, sex-, and calendar year–adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95\% conﬁdence intervals for regional and time-dependent diﬀerences.
Results During the total 106,510,337 cumulative person-years, we identiﬁed 9,443 ﬁrst-ever SAH cases, of which 24\% resulted in death before hospitalization. As compared to western Finland, where the SAH incidence was the lowest (7.4 per 100,000 persons), the ESP-standardized SAH incidence was 1.4 times higher in eastern (10.2 per 100,000 persons; adjusted IRR, 1.37 [1.27–1.47]) and northern Finland (10.4 per 100,000 persons; adjusted IRR, 1.40 [1.30–1.51]). These diﬀerences were similar when men and women were analyzed independently. Although SAH incidence rates decreased in all 5 regions over 2 decades, the rate of decrease varied signiﬁcantly by region.
Conclusion SAH incidence appears to vary substantially by region in Finland. Our results suggest that regional SAH studies can identify high-risk subpopulations, but can also considerably over- or underestimate incidence on a nationwide level.},

METHODS:
Case-ascertainment:
See figure 2


I60.0-I60.6 as primary dx in Finnish PAR.


I60.0-I60.6 as secondary dx in Finnish PAR.


SAH as cause of death in the Finnish DORS (high rate {\textgreater}90\% of coverage in unexpected deaths)


Exclusion of duplicates, i.e. patients dying of I60 without admission


Exclusion of patients with secondary I60 diagnosis.


Inclusion of the remainder that are admitted to neurosurgery or transferred to neurosurgery within 30 days of index event


In the remaining (17k-{\textgreater}1,6k) those dying of SAH within the first year (ie not admitted to neuroserguery) defined as underlying or contributing I60 in DORS are included.


Those dying of other causes within a year are excluded


Amongst 12 mths survivors those with a {\textless}10 day index hospitalization are exlucded, those with {\textgreater}10 days are included.


Step 2-5 (inclusion of secondary I60 and then exclusion) seems redundant, the only effect is, I think, to tease out sudden deaths from those dying in hospital with I60 as a secondary.
Effects of the strategy:


An ICH wrongly coded as I60 I61 with a 10+ day admission at a small hospital surviving a year will be counted as a SAH.


I469 I60 dying in hospital will be excluded (at step 5)


Patients with SAH as index event only managed outside of neurosurgery will and surviving {\textgreater}1 year will be deemed to be SAH+ in 236/916 = 25\% of cases. I believe this to be wildly overestimated. In practice however, these patients will only contribute to 236/9494 SAH patients = 2.5\%.


According to previous work, PPV of SAH in Finnish PAR is 89\% and sensitivity 92\%. The death registry “agreement rate” of diagnosis is 95\%.
Further validation of register-based search (this ascertainment strategy?) on Helsinki patients on local (Helsinki) SAH register.

	abstract = {Objectives—To assess the prognostic value of summary measures of secondary physiological insult in addition to baseline clinical variables for patients with traumatic brain injury.
Methods—A series of 110 patients with traumatic brain injury had data on intracranial pressure (ICP), arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), temperature in °C (Temp), and heart rate in beats/min (HRT) monitored and recorded every minute. Secondary insults were deﬁned according to the Edinburgh University secondary insult grading system. The prognostic value of summary measures of these secondary insults was assessed by adding them to a prognostic model for survival at 1 year after controlling for baseline clinical variables using a previously validated model.
Results—Of the eight secondary insults measured, only ICP added signiﬁcantly to the prediction of survival in the ﬁrst 72 hours after injury. The particular type of summary measure did not seem to inﬂuence the results. After the addition of ICP to the model, none of the other secondary insult measures could improve the predictive power of the model signiﬁcantly.
Conclusions—Early intracranial hypertension is conﬁrmed as a sign of poor prognosis in patients with traumatic brain injury, even after controlling for baseline clinical variables. The value or otherwise of treating such secondary insults, however, can only be deﬁnitively established in the context of prospective randomised controlled trials. The speciﬁc pathophysiological evolution of secondary insults is still the subject of much research, and a clear understanding will be necessary before the development of speciﬁc treatments is feasible.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE  Interfacility neurosurgical transfers to tertiary care centers are driven by a number of variables, including lack of on-site coverage, limited available technology, insurance factors, and patient preference. The authors sought to assess the timing and necessity of surgery and compared transfers to their institution from emergency departments (ED) and inpatient units at other hospitals.
METHODS  Adult neurosurgical patients who were transferred to a single tertiary care center were analyzed over 12 months. Patients with traumatic injuries or those referred from skilled nursing facilities or rehabilitation centers were excluded.
RESULTS  A total of 504 transferred patients were included, with mean age 55 years (range 19–92 years); 53\% of patients were women. Points of origin were ED in 54\% cases and inpatient hospital unit in 46\%, with a mean distance traveled for most patients of 119 miles. Broad diagnosis categories included brain tumors (n = 142, 28\%), vascular lesions, including spontaneous and hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 143, 28\%), spinal lesions (n = 126, 25\%), hydrocephalus (n = 45, 9\%), wound complications (n = 29, 6\%), and others (n = 19, 4\%). Patients transferred from inpatient units had higher rates of surgical intervention (75\% vs 57\%, p {\textless} 0.001), whereas patients transferred from the ED had higher rates of urgent surgery (20\% vs 8\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and shorter mean time to surgery (3 vs 5 days, p {\textless} 0.001). Misdiagnosis rates were higher among ED referrals (11\% vs 4\%, p = 0.008). Across the same timeframe, patients undergoing elective admission (n = 1986) or admission from the authors’ own ED (n = 248) had significantly shorter lengths of stay (p {\textless} 0.001) and ICU days (p {\textless} 0.001) than transferred patients, as well as a significantly lower total cost (\$44,412, \$46,163, and \$72,175, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS  The authors present their 12-month experience from a single tertiary care center without Level I trauma designation. In this cohort, 65\% of patients required surgery, but the rates were higher among inpatient referrals, and misdiagnosis rates were higher among ED transfers. These data suggest that admitting nonemergency patients to local hospitals may improve diagnostic accuracy of patients requiring urgent care, more precisely identify patients in need of transfer, and reduce costs. Referring facilities may lack necessary resources or expertise, and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) obligates tertiary care centers to accept these patients under those circumstances. Telemedicine and integration of electronic medical records may help guide referring hospitals to pursue additional workup, which may eliminate the need for unnecessary transfer and provide additional cost savings.},
